# Aziona – Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Aziona.  
To ensure a consistent, maintainable, and high-quality codebase, please follow the guidelines below.

---

## 1. Before You Start: Open an Issue

Before submitting any pull request, contributors **must open an Issue** describing:

- The problem you intend to solve or the feature you plan to add  
- The rationale behind the change  
- Relevant context, references, or expected impact  

This stage ensures alignment with project priorities and prevents duplicated work.

---

## 2. Code Standards and Quality Requirements

### 2.1 Testing

All contributions must:

- Be fully tested before submission  
- Include **evidence of testing** (logs, screenshots, unit test reports, or coverage summaries)  
- Add or update automated tests when introducing or modifying functionality  

Pull requests without testing evidence will **not** be accepted.

### 2.2 Style and Conventions

All Python code must follow **PEP 8**.  
Consider use formatting and linting tools such as:

- `black`  
- `flake8`  
- `ruff`  

### 2.3 Documentation

If your change affects functionality or user-facing behavior, update the relevant documentation (README, docstrings, or dedicated documentation pages).
